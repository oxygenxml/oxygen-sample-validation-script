# Oxygen Script - Validation Template
This project provides you with a template that uses <i>Oxygen Scripting Validation</i> tool, 
and allows you to validate the files from your GitHub repository. The Validation
Script starts whenever a commit is pushed to your repo, and generates a validation
report that is available on GitHub Pages platform.

To get things ready, follow these steps:
1. Create a new GitHub project using this template. This allows you to easily create a new repository without copying and pasting the content, and with no history or reference to this repository.
   All you have to do is click the <kbd>Use this template</kbd> button. Make sure to check <i>Include all branches</i> option.
2. Get an Oxygen Scripting license key from https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_scripting/pricing.html (you can also request a [trial](https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_scripting/register.html)). Add it as a secret to your repository (Settings -> Secrets -> Actions->New repository secret), and name it "SCRIPTING_LICENSE_KEY". 
3. Open <i>build/gradle.properties</i> file and replace "oxygenxml" with your GitHub {userid}.

Now, as the setup should be ready, you can simply add your files inside the <i>validation</i> directory and push them into your repository.
This will trigger the validation process, that by default validates the entire directory. Feel free to use or remove the sample files provided with this template.

If you want to validate only the files in a specific directory, you need to run the process manually by following these steps:
- In your GitHub repository, click on <b>Actions</b> tab.
- Select <b>Run Validation Script</b> from the left panel.
- Click the <kbd>Run workflow</kbd> button in the right side.
- Type the name of the directory and click <b>Run workflow</b>.

üìù If you already have a repository that you want to perform validation on, you may want to check [Oxygen Validation action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/oxygen-validation) and include it in your workflow.

The validation report generated using Oxygen Scripting should be available here:
https://{userid}.github.io/{reponame}/validationReport.html

The validation report generated from <b>oxygenxml</b> repository is available here:
